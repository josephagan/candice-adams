***A Lottery Ticket in the Rain***  

Sometimes all it takes  
to change your life forever  
is a person you didn't know  
you were looking for.  

              - ian s. thomas

***A Dictionary***

To look at you  
is to want a new word for love,  
because the only word for love is love,  
and when I look at you,  
I feel like you deserve better.

               - ian s. thomas
