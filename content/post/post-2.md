***A Place We Can Talk***

"Is this it?"  

"It's my heart."  

"Is that all of it?"  

"I don't know.  
But everything feels different.
when you hold me.  
The world spins a little faster and  
our days seem a little shorter.  

The stars leave silvery trail behind them  
as they arc across the sky above us.

The sun and the moon chase each  other  
when you hold me.

I am not myself and you are not you."

"Then who are we?"  

"Maybe because we are nothing to no none,  
we are everything to each other.  
And this feeling,  
I swear
is my whole heart."
