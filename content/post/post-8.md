A Stranger on the Street

There are people who  
are too sensitive for the world,  
and thier brain  
gives them lines to say  
that make no sense,  
and all of the nonsense  
and the fairy tales  
and the strange light  
of everything  
goes into them  

and they are beautiful  
in a way few  
will ever know.  

            - ian.s thomas
